## Greetings

Hi! I'm Gun from Rep. of Korea studying at UTokyo as a master student.

My interests is to connect physics and AI.

1. From physics to AI: Defining learning process of AI with non-equilibrium process.
2. From AI to Physics: Data-driven way to discover new experimental, theoretical facts

## About

Our team at AWL, Inc. developed advanced computer vision solutions using deep learning, where I honed my skills in Python and C++. Currently pursuing a Master of Engineering at UTokyo, I'm deeply invested in integrating the principles of physics with the innovation of artificial intelligence. We're exploring data-driven methods to uncover new theoretical insights and experimental facts.

With a scholarship-backed education in applied physics, my work extends beyond academia to practical applications. I contributed to phase-field simulation projects and manage server security, blending technical acumen with a strategic approach to problem-solving. My goal is to foster advancements where AI and physics intersect, guiding innovation in the tech landscape.
